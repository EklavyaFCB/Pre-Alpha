# Pre-Alpha / Mystery Monkeys

A personal game project developed by myself Summer 2016 in order to learn and understand Unity3D in hope to eventually get it published on Steam.

Unfortunately, this project has been discontinued due to a SSD crash. The uploaded files here correspond to an earlier recovered version of the project, and contain incomplete sections and do not reflect the state-of-art lost version of the project.
